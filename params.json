{"name":"Instakill","tagline":"A small Bukkit plugin for creating \"instakill\" items that will immediately remove any nearby mobs. ","body":"Version 1.0 compatibable with Bukkit 1.8+\r\n\r\n## About\r\n\r\nInstakill is a simple plugin that allows you to create custom items that will kill any nearby mobs within a certain radius when right-clicked.\r\n\r\n## Installing\r\n\r\n1. **Download** the latest Jar and place it in your server's plugin folder.\r\n2. **Restart** your server to generate a default configuration file in `.../Instakill/config.yml`.\r\n3. **Customize** the configuration's item ID, name, and lore, and kill options (See [Setting up](#setting-up)).\r\n\r\n## How to use\r\n\r\n### Obtaining an Instakill item\r\n\r\nAny item created normally or using commands in-game that matches the config options will become a usable instakill item. \r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can give yourself or others one instantly with `/ik give`.\r\n\r\n### Using the item's kill effects\r\n\r\nRight-click anywhere in-game while holding your item to instantly kill all mobs near you (in a specified radius).\r\n\r\n## Commands\r\n\r\nAll commands can also be executed with **/instakill**.\r\n\r\n* **/ik give (username) (amount)** - Instally gives the player one or more Instakill item. Defaults to OP only. \r\n\r\n## Permissions\r\n\r\n* **instakill.use** - Allows you to right-click with an Instakill item to kill mobs.\r\n* **instakill.give** - Allows you to use `/ik give` for yourself or other players.\r\n\r\n## Setting up\r\n\r\nIn order to create a non-default Instakill item, you must set it up within the `config.yml`. After editing and saving the file, either restart the server or type `/ik reload` to update the plugin's settings.\r\n\r\nAfter setting up the item in the configuration file, give those who you wish to be able to use the item the `instakill.use` permission.\r\n\r\n### Config.yml\r\n\r\n```\r\nitem-id: 368                # ID number of instakill item\r\nitem-name: Lethal Pearl     # Custom name to display for item\r\nitem-lore:                  # Custom lore/description of item\r\n  - Kills all nearby mobs\r\nkill-radius: 25             # Kill all mobs within this radius of blocks\r\nmob-drops: true             # True or false. Should mobs drop items when instakilled?\r\nconsume-item: true          # True or false. Should the item disappear after one use, or stay in the inventory?\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\\[[Source Code](https://github.com/Andorem/NotifyUser)\\]\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
